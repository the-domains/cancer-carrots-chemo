# You've got cancer.

I heard that phrase a few days before the July 4th weekend in 2015 and again the day before my birthday in August when I was told I also had a different cancer. Both times I felt like I had been punched in the gut and it made me angry. "I don't have time for this."

My doctors' responses were the same. "You are a tough woman you'll get through this". I don't think they realized that by saying I'm tough told me I was in for a hellish ride. One I was not prepared to deal with.

Over 1,685,210 people in the US are told they have cancer each year.   
(http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics). 

Doctors need a response that will hopefully help their shocked patient feel better. "You are tough" did not work for me.

Only one doctor made me feel better by saying I had the right attitude. That worked. She gave me a bit of hope.
